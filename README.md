# 3Clouds Microsoft Word Add-In
## Overview
I created the first version of this Office Add-In for a presentation at SharePoint Saturday New England on October 20, 2018. This version was refactored to leverage the React framework in part so that I could more fully leverage the Office UI Fabric React components. 

Although this add-in does not serve any real purpose, I am iterating on it both to continue to leverage it for future presentations but also to continue to enhance my development skills. It may not be perfect, but it's mine ;-)
